# Diagnosing-Autism-Spectrum-using-Neural-Network

## Introduction
	 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves persistent challenges in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and restricted/repetitive behaviors.

Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be difficult because there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorder. Doctors look at the child's developmental history and behavior to make a diagnosis.

In recent years the number of publications applying computer vision techniques to static medical imagery has grown from hundreds to thousands. A few areas have received substantial attention—radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology—owing to the visual pattern-recognition nature of diagnostic tasks in these specialities, and the growing availability of highly structured images.

This project aims to diagnose autism spectrum disorder based on the child face image using Computer Vision techniques.

## Background
	MU Researchers Identify Differences in Facial Characteristics of Children with Autism Compared to Typically Developing Children, found :
 Children with autism have a broader upper face, including wider eyes.
Children with autism have a shorter middle region of the face, including the cheeks and nose.
Children with autism have a broader or wider mouth and philtrum – the divot below the nose, above the top lip.
